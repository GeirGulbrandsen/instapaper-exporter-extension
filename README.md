# Instapaper highlights exporter

A simple Chrome extension that adds a button to your browser toolbar which, when clicked, will export your Instapaper highlights as an HTML page (with JSON output included).

Not published on the Chrome store, you'll have to clone, npm install, npm run build, then go to Chrome extensions, turn on developer mode, click on Load unpacked, and point it to `dist/chrome/extension` in this directory.

I might publish it, I also made a PR upstream to sawyerh if he ever wanted to incorporate it in his extension. Also thought about bundling it with the Roam Toolkit plugin.
